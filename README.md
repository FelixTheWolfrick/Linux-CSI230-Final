# Linux-CSI230-Final
Final for Linux CSI-230 Fall 2020

Summary:
  This program will take in a list of customers names, their orders & how much they spent from an input txt file. It will then get how much you spent in production costs, calculate the total revenue based off of everything everyone bought and calculate your profit. This information is then saved in the export txt file.
  
Instructions:
  Just run the make file and answer the questions the program asks for. Make sure the input and export files and txt files. You can use your own files or use the example files I included. If you make your own input file make sure to follow the stadard of [ Customer Name | Customer Order | Price ] since this is the order the variables are stored in and the | is what seperates them.
  
Libraries:
    The calculations.hpp is a calculator library I found on github. The link to it is included in the .hpp file.
